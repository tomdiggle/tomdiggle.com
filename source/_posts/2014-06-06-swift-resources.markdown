The other day I managed to sit down and start to get to grips with Apple's new programming language Swift. Already there appears to be a huge amount of top quality learning material. Below I have listed resources that I found useful.

## Apple
The first place to look is Apple's developer site. There's lots of material, from the official Swift blog to videos of WWDC 2014 sessions and of course the Swift book.

- [Swift Blog](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/)
- [The Swift Book](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/)

## Cheat Sheets
Closures in Swift just like blocks on Objective-C are going to take a while to memorise a good cheat sheet is always handy to have close by.
