My "Open With" menu option was getting way out of hand and I can never remember the command to clean it up so, I created [this Alfred 2 workflow](https://github.com/tomdiggle/CleanUpOpenWith).

## Usage

Once installed all you need to do is type `cleanupow` into Alfred and hit enter. Open With will be rebuilt and Finder will relaunch.

## Enjoy
You can get the workflow on [Github](https://github.com/tomdiggle/CleanUpOpenWith). If anyone wants to, they can help pretty it up by designing an icon.
