Wager was the very first app I built for iOS back in 2010 and was released for iOS 4. It was the app I used to learn Objective-C and now version 4 has been built from scratch using Swift 2. Wager is available to download from the [App Store](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wager/id378869159?mt=8){:target=“_blank”} and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomdiggle/wager){:target=“_blank”}.
