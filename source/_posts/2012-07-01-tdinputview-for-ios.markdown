TDInputView is an open source replacement for the standard system keyboard in iOS 4.0+. TDInputView subclasses UITextField and replaces the inputView with a custom UIView that you can design. Below is a screenshot of TDInputView in action from my app Wager which can be downloaded from the App Store for free [here](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wager-lite/id405046159?mt=8).

You can download a copy of TDInputView from GitHub [here](https://github.com/tomdiggle/TDInputView). It'll be great to hear from you if you do find this useful.
