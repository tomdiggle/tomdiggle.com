You might or might not have noticed, my website looks a little different. I’ve completely changed the entire design and switched from [Octopress](http://octopress.org) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

My main goals for the redesign where:

1. Lightweight & readable
2. Responsive design
3. Minimal JavaScript
4. No tracking cookies (except analytics)

I think I’ve done a decent job at meeting those requirements. The site should behave well on all modern browsers. 

More than likely, the site will have some rough edges please [let me know](/contact/) if you spot any broken links, typos, etc.

There will be a post shortly which will explain in more detail my design process and how I built the site.

Thank you for taking the time to read my posts.
