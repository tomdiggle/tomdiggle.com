  description: Mark approached me to create a website that would help raise his profile as a professional cyclist and increase his fan base. The new website uses a custom responsive theme for WordPress. The custom build is very flexible and makes use of the WordPress Theme Customization API and a custom Results plugin that allow Mark to perform regular updates easily without hassle.
