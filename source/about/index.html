            <h2>About Tom</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Tom and I'm a web developer with a passion for iOS, based in the UK. You can view the work I’ve done for clients in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/" title="View work I've done">portfolio</a> or read about some of my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apps/" title="View my apps">self published apps</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/" title="View my projects">projects</a>. Hopefully on this page you’ll learn more about me. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:tom@tomdiggle.com" title="Send an email to tom@tomdiggle.com">get in touch</a>.</p>

            <p>I started by developing <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apps/#wager" title="View details about Wager">Wager</a> a betting odds calculator that was released on the App Store in 2010. Shortly after, I developed <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sitmosapp" title="View details about SITMOS - Podcast App">SITMOS - Podcast App</a> so I could listen to my favourite podcast Stuck in the Middle of Somewhere - which has since been removed from the App Store.</p>


            <p>I’ve since gone on to work as a freelance web developer helping a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/" title="View my projects">number of clients</a> generate more leads and increase their brand awareness.</p>

            <p><strong>I’m currently available</strong>, if you have a project you’d like to discuss you can email me <a href="mailto:tom@tomdiggle.com" title="Send an email to tom@tomdiggle.com">tom@tomdiggle.com</a> or take a look at the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/" title="View work I've done">work I’ve previously done</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apps/" title="View my apps">my apps</a>.</p>
